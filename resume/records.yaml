    I have 6 years rich experience as a QA engineer and, after a 2 year
    hiatus as a craftsperson, am eager to make the most of both my
    technical domain knowledge and broadened life experience. I have worked
    in everything from plucky startups to household names, done everything
    from test analysis to framework development, and over the years have
    developed a strong appreciation for the nuanced nature of quality assessment.

  title: Experiments with Bash and Python

    I often find projects start with a Bash script. It's a great language
    for stitching together external tools or doing weird things with the file system.
    Despite that certain operations might as well be black magic in terms of readability,
    and sometimes a feature just isn't there (no hash tables before Bash 4?!).
    That's why I came up with a tool - Pysh - which gives you a persistent
    Python interpreter which is easily accessed inline from Bash. This was a great
    learning experience for me where I gained an appreciation for the difference
    between in- and out-of-band signaling, and what exactly a fifo is good for.

    Pysh is a tool I created in a bid to elegantly embed Python into Bash. This was a great
    learning experience for me where I gained an appreciation for the difference
    between in- and out-of-band signaling, and what exactly a fifo is good for.

notes:
  title: Music theory with Python
  url: https://github.com/oscarbyrne/notes
  text: >-
    I have a number of hobbyist projects using Python, but the one which I am most
    happy about (aka the most recent!) is a tool for composers which classifies
    musical objects according to 'musical set theory'. In this project I have come
    to realise how the abstract base classes for containers defined in the standard
    library can be used to cleanly define custom classes. It is also a good example
    of how I try to keep method definitions to be 5 lines or less, often with the
    help of Python's excellent itertools module.

pyatonic:
  title: Advanced music theory with Python
  url: https://github.com/oscarbyrne/pyatonic
  text: >-
    Music theory is one of my passions. I've recently had the opportunity to dive deep
    into some of the concepts I've been reading about, requiring working knowledge in a
    host of new concepts from category theory to tree search algorithms. The result is
    a library of methods ultimately able to demonstrate computational creativity (yes!)
    by conceptually "blending" musical chords, an algorithm developed as recently as 2015.
    The code itself showcases my ability to write in a pythonic style: making heavy use
    of generators, a mastery of Python's data model, and avoiding the over-reliance
    on classes often found with junior developers.

    When job hunting I find I spend an inordinate amount of time formatting my resume.
    To cut down on this time I created a library which creates beautifully-formatted
    resumes in the time it takes to hit my enter key. By storing the important data
    - job records and document layout - in a series of easily-editable config files
    and generating responsive HTML5 via a Jinja2 template, I create first-class resumes
    in an instant. You're reading one right now!
