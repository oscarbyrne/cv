            <p>I'm a curious developer with a particular loyalty to Python, although I'll use whatever tool is best for the job. If I learn something new I like to learn how to use it properly. That means: beautiful interfaces; no fear for refactoring; and, of course, following the style guidelines(!).

                    <h3>Experiments with Bash and Python</h3>

                </header>
                <p>I often find projects start with a Bash script. It's a great language for stitching together external tools or doing weird things with the file system. Despite that certain operations might as well be black magic in terms of readability, and sometimes a feature just isn't there (no hash tables before Bash 4?!). That's why I came up with a tool - Pysh - which gives you a persistent Python interpreter which is easily accessed inline from Bash. This was a great learning experience for me where I gained an appreciation for the difference between in- and out-of-band signalling, and what exactly a fifo is good for.

                    <h3>Music theory with Python</h3>
                    <i>https://github.com/oscarbyrne/notes</i>
                </header>
                <p>I have a number of hobbyist projects using Python, but the one which I am most happy about (aka the most recent!) is a tool for composers which classifies musical objects according to 'musical set theory'. In this project I have come to realise how the abstract base classes for containers defined in the standard library can be used to cleanly define custom classes. It is also a good example of how I try to keep method definitions to be 5 lines or less, often with the help of Python's excellent itertools module.
