----------
Motivation
----------

I'm a curious developer with a particular loyalty to Python, although I'll use whatever tool is best for the job. If I learn something new I like to learn how to use it *properly*. What you should know about me: there’s nothing better than a neat source file. That means: beautiful interfaces; no fear for refactoring; and, of course, following the style guidelines(!).

Work Experience
---------------

`Cisco, Software Engineer`__
----------------------------
| *January 2016 - July 2016*

__ https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1729902

Acano was acquired by Cisco for $700m, after which I was moved to a new agile team to develop a next-gen, **Android-based** product running on custom hardware. This involved building an **entirely new testing environment** using industry-standard technologies.

*Accomplishments:*
``````````````````
- Planned our overarching **test strategy**, reviewing existing technologies and methodologies.
- Constructed an all-**hardware test lab**, including network provisions and remote power switching (there was a risk that early prototypes would burst into flames if left on overnight!)
- Developed a custom **test runner** for our product able to: prepare the hardware for testing, run tests in parallel and collect useful reports including screenshots. This involved hacking in **Java**, **Gradle**, and **Python**.
- Developed a **continuous-integration** environment using technologies including: **Jenkins**, **Phabricator** and **Docker**.

`Acano, QA Engineer`__
----------------------
| *October 2014 – January 2016*

__ https://www.acano.com/

I joined the QA team at Acano in the first wave of graduate recruits. I initially worked on manual testing and writing test plans, but soon graduated to developing frameworks for **automated tests**.

*Accomplishments:*
``````````````````
- Wrote much of the **test plan** for our client software, greatly improving our manual test coverage. This had a noticeable effect on the stability of our product.
- Was the sole QA on a project to deliver a **SIP to H323** bridge for the server component of our product. This involved working closely with a single developer to a very short development cycle.
- Designed and **developed the framework** for running automated tests on the next generation of our client software. There was no automation of the client prior to this, and some existing core systems had to be rewritten to accommodate the new module. The framework is a ‘write once run anywhere’ system, written in **Python** and **shell**, that runs tests on multiple platforms including: **Android, iOS, Windows, Mac** and various **web browsers**.


|

`DESY, Summer Studentship Computing Program`__
----------------------------------------------
| *July 2013 – August 2013*

__ http://www.desy.de/index_eng.html

A 2 month paid internship working with the world's **most brilliant X-ray source** at DESY (Germany's answer to CERN). Aside from a minor project involving RPC technologies, I cut my teeth on Python developing an automated toolchain for processing tomographic images.

Arduino-Based Synthesiser
-------------------------

.. |grains| replace:: *https://github.com/oscarbyrne/grains*

I became interested in the Arduino platform for generating audio after building some simple audio-based electronic circuits. This has involved developing my own **1-bit DAC**, requiring a **custom PWM** implementation, which I ultimately intend to output audio generated on the chip. Getting this close to the metal was a great experience, and I really enjoyed pushing the limits of the chip.

Python Meta-Programming

**I am interested in developing beautiful interfaces**, to the point where they almost become programming languages in their own right. Python’s high capacity for metaprogramming makes this possible. I have **2 projects** available on my github demonstrating this - ‘notes’, which is a tool for exploring music theory; and ‘vikings’, the latest iteration of a modern ‘text adventure’ game I have been toying with for several years (note this is very much a work in progress).

This CV
-------

.. |cv| replace:: *https://github.com/oscarbyrne/cv*

I have written this CV with the help of the **reStructuredText syntax**. This is a markup language designed to compile easily to PDF and HTML, whilst remaining easily human-readable. I honestly think my CV is the best (looking) out there written using this language!

Education
---------

`University of Birmingham, MSci Physics`__
------------------------------------------
| *2010 - 2014*

__ http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/physics/physics-msci.aspx

For my fourth year project I became involved with **front-line research** in metamaterials, and contributed to a project which was presented as part of the PIERS conference 2014 in China. I chose mostly computing-related modules, including:

- **Computational Modelling of Physical Systems,** for which I implemented a dynamical billiards simulation using **C++**
- **Teaching in Schools,** for which I spent 11 weeks teaching in a Primary school
- **Image Processing,** which mostly focused on algorithms
