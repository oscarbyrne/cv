  motivation:
    text: >-
      I'm a curious developer with a particular loyalty to Python,
      although I'll use whatever tool is best for the job. If I
      learn something new I like to learn how to use it properly.
      That means: beautiful interfaces; no fear for refactoring;
      and, of course, following the style guidelines(!).

  globalme:

      - Established processes – code review, development phases – for the team in Vancouver
      - Mentored (including leading training sessions in Git and Python) a team of 9 manual testers
      - "Technologies: Ansible, Python, Bash, Powershell"

      - Drove adoption of agile work style by championing test automation
      - Developed a “write once, run anywhere” test framework covering Android, iOS, Windows, Mac and web
      - Planned comprehensive testing strategy (including CI with remote teams) for next-gen product
      - "Technologies: Python, Java, Bash"

  desy:

    bullets:
      - Lived in Hamburg, Germany studying the world’s most brilliant x-ray source
      - Created an RPC endpoint for sharing experimental data
      - Developed an image processing toolchain in Python for analysing tomographic data

    title: Experiments with Bash and Python
    subtitle: https://github.com/oscarbyrne/pysh
    text: >-
      I often find projects start with a Bash script. It's a great language
      for stitching together external tools or doing weird things with the file system.
      Despite that certain operations might as well be black magic in terms of readability,
      and sometimes a feature just isn't there (no hash tables before Bash 4?!).
      That's why I came up with a tool - Pysh - which gives you a persistent
      Python interpreter which is easily accessed inline from Bash. This was a great
      learning experience for me where I gained an appreciation for the difference
      between in- and out-of-band signalling, and what exactly a fifo is good for.
  
  notes:
    title: Music theory with Python
    subtitle: https://github.com/oscarbyrne/notes
    text: >-
      I have a number of hobbyist projects using Python, but the one which I am most
      happy about (aka the most recent!) is a tool for composers which classifies
      musical objects according to 'musical set theory'. In this project I have come
      to realise how the abstract base classes for containers defined in the standard
      library can be used to cleanly define custom classes. It is also a good example
      of how I try to keep method definitions to be 5 lines or less, often with the
      help of Python's excellent itertools module.
  
  degree:
    title: MSCi Physics
    subtitle: University of Birmingham
    dates: 2010 - 2014
    text: >-
      For my fourth year project I became involved with front-line research
      in metamaterials, and contributed to a project which was presented
      as part of the PIERS conference 2014 in China. I chose mostly
      computing-related modules, including:
    bullets:
      - Computational Modelling of Physical Systems
      - Teaching in Schools
      - Image Processing
  
  interests:
    bullets:
      - Silver smithing, rockhounding and lapidary
      - Producing electronic music
      - Hiking
